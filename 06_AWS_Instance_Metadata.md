## AWS Instance Metadata and more

### Instance Metadata
AWS instance metadata provides information about your EC2 instance itself, accessible from within the instance. It includes details like:
* **Instance ID:** Unique identifier for your instance.
* **Instance Type:** Type of EC2 instance (e.g., t2.micro, c5.xlarge).
* **Public IP Address:** Public IP address assigned to the instance.
* **Private IP Address:** Private IP address within the VPC (if applicable).
* **Availability Zone:** Zone where the instance is running.
* **Security Groups:** Security groups associated with the instance.
* **User Data:** Optional user data provided during launch.
* **AMI ID:** ID of the AMI used to launch the instance.

#### Accessing Instance Metadata
* **Linux:** Use the `curl` or `wget` command to fetch metadata from a specific URL (e.g., `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`).
* **Windows:** Use the `PowerShell` command `Get-MetadataService -Path <metadata-key>`.
* **Other OSes:** AWS SDKs are available for various languages to access metadata programmatically.

### Importance of metadata for Developers
* **Configuration Management:** Retrieve instance-specific configuration details during application startup.
* **Dynamic Scaling:** Automatically scale your application based on instance capabilities.
* **Security Best Practices:** Use instance ID or security group information for access control.


### IP Address and Stopping/Starting Instances
* **Public IP:** By default, the public IP address can change when you stop and restart an instance in a public subnet.
* **Retaining IP (Elastic IP):** To maintain a static IP, allocate an Elastic IP or Static IP address and associate it with your instance. Elastic IPs remain independent of the instance state. AWS provides a certain number of EIPs for free, and additional ones incur charges based on usage.


### Need for Static vs. Dynamic IPs
* **Static IP:**
    * Needed for inbound connections from external sources that require a fixed IP address (e.g., web servers, VPN endpoints).
    * Easier to manage security rules for inbound traffic.
* **Dynamic IP:**
    * Suitable for internal resources within a VPC that communicate with each other using private IPs.
    * More efficient for auto-scaling deployments where instances come and go.

### Number of Reservable IPs
* You can allocate a maximum of 5 Elastic IPs per AWS account by default.
* Contact AWS support to increase this limit if needed.

### Pricing for Elastic IPs
* You are charged a fixed hourly rate for each Elastic IP address you allocate, regardless of whether it's associated with a running instance.
* There are no charges for data transfer associated with Elastic IPs.

### Summary
Instance metadata provides valuable information for configuring and managing your applications on AWS. By understanding IP assignment and Elastic IPs, you can choose the right approach for your needs and optimize your AWS resource usage.
